#### 1.5.5 (2019-04-12)

##### Improvements

* If no response has been received from the SysAp within 5 seconds the accessory will show an error within HomeKit and the pending event will be cleaned up. This prevents the HomeKit UI from not responding for up to 1 minute with left over event which eventually may crash homebridge.

#### 1.5.4 (2019-04-01)

##### Improvements

* **BuschJaegerJalousieAccessory**:  
    Moving the shutters is now more reliable (than ever) and should not cause the shutters to stop and start when the position is changed multiple times while moving. Additionally position changes should now be exact and reflect the actual window.

#### 1.5.3 (2019-01-25)

##### Bug Fixes

* Fixed crash if all channels of an actuator were blacklisted.

#### 1.5.2 (2018-09-18)

##### Features
